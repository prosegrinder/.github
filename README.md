## Workflows

Workflows are designed based on
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

In general, workflows should follow this pattern:

1. Default (typically main) is protected and only updated via PRs.
2. Every PR should pass linting and tests, found in the languageâ€™s CI workflow
3. On merge, the release workflow should

The following are reusable workflows per language.

### Python Poetry

Conventional commits will drive versioning via the Python implementation of
[commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/).

- [Poetry Lint](.github/workflows/poetry-lint.yaml): Runs `pylint` and `black`.
- [Poetry Test](.github/workflows/poetry-test.yaml): Runs `pytest` tests.
- [Poetry CI](.github/workflows/poetry-ci.yaml):
  - Invoke on `push` to PR branch.
  - MUST pass in order to merge PR.
  - Combines Lint and Test into a single workflow.
- [Poetry Release](.github/workflows/poetry-release.yaml)
  - Invoke on `push` to `main`, typically via PR merge.
  - Runs both Lint and Test to ensure project integrity.
  - Bumps the project version and generates a changelog via Commitizen, based on
    Conventional Commits.
  - Tags the project and pushes changes to main.
  - Creates a GitHub release based on the tag and the changelog created by
    Commitizen.
- [Poetry Publish](.github/workflows/poetry-publish.yaml)
  - Invoke on `tag`, typically via Poetry Release.
  - Builds the project.
  - Optionally publishes to PyPi test. See workflow for details.
  - Publish to PyPi.
